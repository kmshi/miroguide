  <h2><a name="appreject">How to Approve/Reject Channels</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Log in and go to the <a href="{{ BASE_URL }}moderate">moderate</a> link.
      <br />
      <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/appreject-01.jpg" alt="" />
    </li>

    <li>
      Go to the <a href="{{ BASE_URL }}channels/moderator-list/new">Unreviewed Channels</a> (it is possible to do this in Firefox or Miro).
      <br />
      <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/appreject-02.jpg" alt="" />
    </li>

    <li>
      Add the first channel (the channels that have been waiting longest are at top). You can optionally click the "Subscribe to all 10 channels" link at the top of the page to save time.
      <br />
      <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/appreject-03.jpg" alt="" />
    </li>

    <li>Now it's time to kick the channel's tires:</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Does the feed work? If you get an error, just
        choose "No" and then click the "Broken" button from the Standard
        Rejections. The channel manager will get a helpful e.mail with
        information and links.
        <br />
        <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/appreject-04a.jpg" alt="" />
        <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/appreject-04aa.jpg" alt="" />
      </li>

      <li>
        Does the media obviously violate copyright?
        You are not a copyright cop. However, if you see full episodes of the Simpsons, and they aren't coming from Fox's website (hulu.com), the channel probably isn't legit. If something is unclear, approve it and the copyright holder can file a DMCA request. If you click the reject for "Copyright" button, the channel manager will be contacted and have a chance to respond.
        <br />
        <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/appreject-04b.jpg" alt="" />
        The explicit stuff and spam is the most subjective and difficult to deal with. We will eventually have an user based solution (i.e. Miro users will decide what they think is inappropriate or explicit, and get warnings based on what other users do). However, for the time being, we make the call.
        Our rule of thumb is that if a feed would get an X rating (esp. if it involves explicit sex), we don't allow it in the guide. Also, if the channel looks like pure spam you can reject it. If you're not comfortable making this judgement, just click the "Don't Know" button. Otherwise, choose "Explicit" from the Standard Rejections. The channel manager will be contacted and have a chance to respond.
        <br />
        <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/appreject-04c.jpg" alt="" />
      </li>

      <li>
        If you see a channel that is all audio files (.mp3 or similar), just click the "Audio" button.
        <br />
        <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/appreject-04d.jpg" alt="" />
      </li>

      <li>
        If you find other problems, such as video formats
        that don't play back, you can make a custom rejection. It will send the
        channel manager an email that they can respond to.
        <br />
        <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/appreject-04e.jpg" alt="" />
      </li>

      <li>
        If you are ever not sure what to do, simply click the "Don't Know" button and let someone else help you make the decision.
        <br />
        <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/appreject-04f.jpg" alt="" />
      </li>

      <li>
        If the channel made it through all the tests, you
        can Approve it! The channel manager will automatically receive a
        congratulatory email.
        <br />
        <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/appreject-05.jpg" alt="">

      </ol>
    <li class="last">Rinse and repeat.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="comown">Communicating with Channel Managers</a></h2>

  <p>Any time you reject a feed or add a message to the "Conversation
  with Channel Manager" (this is at the bottom of every channel page), an
  email message is sent to the manager. They will get your note and be able
  to respond.</p>
  <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/comown-01.jpg" alt="" />

  <p>Whenever a channel manager adds a message or replies in the
  conversation, their channel will appear in the "Channels waiting for
  Reply" section. The channels in this section should be treated as high
  priority.</p>
  <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/comown-02.jpg" alt="" />

  <p class="last">When a channel is "Waiting for Reply", you simply reply to the
  message (or re-reject the channel, if it is still not approvable) and
  the channel will fall out of the "Waiting for Reply" section.</p>

  <h2><a name="commod">Communicating with Fellow Moderators</a></h2>

  <p>There is a very basic bulletin board built into the channel guide.
  The latest posts show up on the main moderation page, in order to see
  the history and/or post your own message, click the (<a href="{{ BASE_URL }}notes/moderator-board">see all posts</a>) link.</p>
  <img src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/commod-01.jpg" alt="" />

  <p><strong>IRC Channel:</strong> <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net#miro">#miro</a> (irc.freenode.net).</p>
  <p>You can access the channel with a traditional client, or through this <a href="http://www.getmiro.com/teammiro/">web interface</a>. Remember, just type anyone's full nickname into a conversation to get their attention.
  </p>

  <p>GetSatisfaction is where a lot of support for Miro happens. If you're able to join in and answer a few <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/participatoryculturefoundation/unanswered/topics">unanswered questions</a>, that is excellent.</p>

  <p class="last"><strong>Team Miro Mailing List:</strong> this <a href="http://participatoryculture.org/mailman/listinfo/teammiro">list</a> is intended for volunteers, Miro enthusiasts, and anyone else who is excited about getting involved.</p>

  <h2><a name="share">Sharing Favorite Channels with Moderators</a></h2>

  <p>Just click the "Share with Moderators" button and the channel will
  be available on the main moderation control panel. If you approve a
  channel that seems interesting or appealing, definitely <strong>share the love</strong>.</p>
  <img class="last" src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL }}images/how-to-moderate/share-01.jpg" alt="" />

  <h2><a name="dontknow">Dealing with "Don't Know" Channels</a></h2>

  <p>If you see something in here, you should basically treat it as an
  "unapproved channel" that someone else wasn't sure how to deal with. If
you're a more experienced moderator, you should treat these as higher
  priority. Use the same guidelines for approving it, as <a href="#appreject">outlined above</a>.</p>
  <img class="last" src="{{ STATIC_BASE_URL}}images/how-to-moderate/dontknow-01.jpg" alt="" />

  <h2><a name="supermod">What is Super Moderator Status?</a></h2>

  <p>There are two levels of moderator -- Moderator and Super Moderator.
  They are very similar, except that Super Mods can feature channels.</p>

  <p class="last">Super Mod status is pretty powerful &mdash; we promote people who have: been around the community for a while, proven themselves to be a reliable moderator, and are a good judge of channels (ie. share your favorites!).</p>

  <h2><a name="bugs">Reporting Miro Guide Bugs and Suggesting Features</a></h2>

  <p>If you find something that seems buggy or wrong, you can add a <a href="http://bugzilla.pculture.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=miroguide&format=guided">ticket</a> to the channel guide <a href="http://bugzilla.pculture.org/buglist.cgi?bug_severity=blocker&bug_severity=critical&bug_severity=major&bug_severity=normal&bug_severity=minor&bug_severity=trivial&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bugidtype=include&chfield=%5BBug%20creation%5D&chfieldvalue=&field-1-0-0=product&field-1-1-0=bug_status&field-1-2-0=bug_severity&field0-0-0=noop&product=MiroGuide&query_format=advanced&remaction=&type-1-0-0=anyexact&type-1-1-0=anyexact&type-1-2-0=anyexact&type0-0-0=noop&value-1-0-0=MiroGuide&value-1-1-0=NEW%2CASSIGNED%2CREOPENED&value-1-2-0=blocker%2Ccritical%2Cmajor%2Cnormal%2Cminor%2Ctrivial&value0-0-0=&query_based_on=">bug tracker</a>.</p>
  <p>If you have a great idea, please submit it as a <a href="http://bugzilla.pculture.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=miroguide&format=enhancement">feature request</a>;
  please keep in mind that we run a tight ship and must very carefully consider each new feature.</p>
