        Our moderators will review your feed in the next few days to make
        sure that it works in Miro and that the content is not
        inappropriate.  Once the feed is approved, it will appear in the
        'Just Added' section on the front page.

        The buttons below point to the feed you've just submitted-- just
        paste the HTML into your blog or website. When users click on
        the button, Miro will open and they will be automatically
        subscribed to your feed.

        1-click buttons are a great way to get your viewers connected to
        your content on an ongoing basis. If you have any questions
        about the buttons, email: channels [at] pculture [d] org.
