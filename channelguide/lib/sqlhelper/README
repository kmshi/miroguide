sqlhelper -- Package to ease the pain of working with SQL databases.

This package was created for channel guide, but I wanted to separate it from
the rest of the code.  My hope is that I can re-use this stuff.

There are 2 sub-packages:
  * sql helps create SQL statements
  * orm maps database tables to objects

Overall, I tried to keep things as simple as possible and tried to avoid
having the complexity of something like SQLAlchemy.  This keeps the codebase
easy to understand, which means that apps can easily extend it.

To run the test suite, copy testsettings.py.template to testsettings.py and
fill in the values.  Then run test.py.
