   * Version 1.34

   * In get_multi, if the recv loop reads 0 bytes, raising an EOFError.
     Identified by Jim Baker.

   * Version 1.33

   * Including patch from Yoshinori K. Okuji to read in larger chunks for
   readline() calls.  This should dramatically improve performance under
   some circumstances.

   * Version 1.32

   * Including patch from Philip Neustrom which checks keys sent to the
   server for length and bad characters.

   * Version 1.31

   *  Rolled version 1.30 since the Danga folks are now listing this
   version as the official version.  Removing the "tummy" from the version
   number, and incrementing so that it's clear it's more recent than "1.2".

   * Patch applied from Simon Forman for handling of weighted hosts.

   * Added a little more meat to the README.

   * cludwin at socallocal suggested that the write-combining with
   sendall() may not be beneficial.  After testing on both SMP and non-SMP
   machines, I can't see a significant benefit to not doing the
   write-combining, even on large strings.  The benefits of write-combining
   on smaller strings seems to be significant on UP machines in tight loops.
   Even on strings that are larger than 2MB, there seems to be no benefit to
   splitting out the writes.

   * Changing a printf to debuglog and catching a pickle exception, patch
   submitted by Justin Azoff.

   * Alex Stapleton found that the sendall call was slow for writing data
   larger than several kilobytes.  I had him test a change to his patch,
   which worked as well, but was simpler.  The code now does two sendall
   calls, one for the data and one for the line termination, if the data is
   larger than 100 bytes.

   * Incorporating some fixes to get_multi() from Bo Yang

   * Simplifying the readline() function and speeding it up ~25%.
   * Fixing a bug in readline() if the server drops, mark_dead() was not
      being properly called.

   * Adding "stats()" and "flush_all()" methods.

Thu, 10 Aug 2003 12:17:50 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>

   * Slightly more verbose self-test output.
   * Fix mark_dead() to use proper classname.
   * Make pooltest.py run from the test directory.

   * Add incr, decr, and delete.
   * Better Python (based on comments from Uriah Welcome).
   * Docs, using epydoc.

   * Initial prerelease.
