			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I???m not the kind of guy who likes to call the cops. In fact, I???ll do everything I can to settle my disputes without involving the police. You could even say I was sent to prison to avoid getting involved ??? we???ll get to that later.</p>
<p>But when I was mugged by Terrell Tramell, 28, Feb. 4, just after 1 a.m., in the Lower Haight neighborhood of San Francisco, I felt like the only choice I had was to call the police.</p>
<p>I first met Trammell in 2006 while I was inmate number 98005-011 at the Dublin Federal Detention Center. He was number 92544-011, but everyone called him ???Rail,??? or ???Rell.???</p>
<p>I was sent to prison by Federal Judge William Alsup after I refused to testify before a Federal Grand Jury about the identities and activities of protesters I had covered for my video blog and for refusing to surrender my video outtakes. I was held in contempt of court for 226 days and was released after publishing the video. I did not have to testify.</p>
<p>Rail was at FDC Dublin for violating the terms of his probation. I don???t know what he was accused of doing, but he wasn???t  there very long. But early the next year he returned to Dublin on another violation. There were only two people that I had any problems with while I was incarcerated, and I was frequently harassed by Rail for no apparent reason while we were both incarcerated. He was most recently released Nov. 7, and I have seen him in my neighborhood several times in the past few months.</p>
<p>Up until last week, I had thought that things were civil between us. After so many short casual conversations, I honestly didn???t  expect that he would attack me that night. Less than 15 minutes before the attack we had been talking at Volare???s Pizza after I returned to the city for a late dinner. We chatted about the local pizza spots, Greg Anderson (Barry Bond???s personal trainer that was also detained for civil contempt at FDC Dublin while we were both there), and even our respective occupations. He was ???working right now,??? he said.</p>
<p>As I walked home carrying the box of pizza in one hand and two sodas in the other, I heard Rail call from across the street, ???Got a light????</p>
<p>Being the kind of person that I am I awkwardly fished out a lighter from my pocket as he crossed the street. But when I went to hand him the lighter I was greeted with a punch to the face and the pizza went flying.</p>
<p>I lost my glasses and called out for help, as a quick series of jabs to the face continued. But my cries for help were only greeted by a friend of his I had first seen at the pizza place coming to his aid. I fell to the ground asking, ???What do you want???? as I began to wonder if this was a robbery or simply a beating. The punches became kicks. I shielded my face.</p>
<p>???Let???s go,??? said the friend as the kicks continued.</p>
<p>Rail then grabs me by the jacket and reaches into my inner pocket where he had most likely seen me place my iPhone after I received a call at the pizza place. He grabs my left pocket, where my car and house keys are being kept. He tears the pocket, but in the runs away with his friend.</p>
<p>Blood squirting from my nose, heart pounding, I lie on the ground for a moment collecting myself as I watch the feet of my two assailants dart away.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was my dinner,&#8221; I thought to myself as I stood up and saw the pizza splattered across the sidewalk.</p>
<p>A neighbor opens her door and steps out to ask if there???s anything she can do to help.</p>
<p>???Got a phone???? I ask.</p>
<p>She returns a moment later with a cell phone in hand. I dial 911. She notices the blood and comes back with a wet washcloth.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the police arrive. I flag them down with the bloody washcloth as if I am hailing a cab. An ambulance arrives later.</p>
<p>Several more cops arrive.</p>
<p>???Which way did they go???? one officer asks. They speed away in pursuit of a vague description of two young black males.</p>
<p>The officers ask me in the ambulance to tell them what I know. I give them a full description and explain how I know one of the men that attacked me, but cannot recall either his real name or even his alias. I tell the paramedics that I don&#8217;t need to go to the hospital.</p>
<p>I???m handed two pieces of paper. One of them has a case number  written on it and the phone number for the robbery department circled. The other slip has the number for the city???s crime victim???s assistance program.</p>
<p>The moment I sit down in my kitchen, the name ???Rail??? returns to my memory and I pick up the phone to call the robbery department. But the number is only in service during regular business hours and it just rings and rings.</p>
<p>So I call the Central District, and speak to someone who explains that the crime occurred in the Northern District. When I ring up Northern, I am told that nobody can deal with the case at this time and that I will have to wait until 9 a.m. and talk to Robbery.</p>
<p>When I call Robbery, I am told that unless there are witnesses, and I, as the victim, don???t count, that the District Attorney won???t prosecute. He implies that it???s unlikely anyone will be following up on the case, despite the fact that I tell him I know who did it and the name his known by on the street.</p>
<p>Discouraged, I leave a message at the District Attorney???s office, talk to someone at the Mayor???s office and leave a message for my County Supervisor, Ross Mirkarimi.</p>
<p>That night I get a call from a detective that tells me he knows who I am talking about and says that he will prepare a photo lineup so that I can identify the guy the next day. Later on that night, I find out more about Rail than I ever wanted to know, including the fact that we???re neighbors.</p>
<p>Having half a mind to tell the police to forget the whole situation, I&#8217;m forced to ponder my options.</p>
<p>If I press charges, then Rail will likely try to retaliate as soon as he&#8217;s released. But if I do nothing then I am likely to be perceived as a chump and it&#8217;s only so long until I&#8217;m forced to deal with him again.</p>
<p>Had this happened in prison, the appropriate response would have been to talk to the black shot-caller and let &#8216;his people&#8217; take care of the situation; anything else would likely erupt in a race riot. </p>
<p>But it happened on the streets where things aren&#8217;t black and white. And I wasn&#8217;t looking for retribution. </p>
<p>I would&#8217;ve liked to have just walked away, bruised and beaten, but ready to write it off as a very bad day.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not in the game. But our worlds had collided, and simply hoping he&#8217;d leave me alone didn&#8217;t seem like a smart idea.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason you don&#8217;t mug people that know you. Especially ones that live in your neighborhood. It makes things complicated.</p>
<p>And leaves me without out a whole lot of options.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the kind of guy who likes to call the cops. </p>
<p>But after hearing from a mutual acquaintance that Rail was unwilling to offer his assurances that I wouldn&#8217;t have any more problems, I felt I had no choice but to point to his photo when the detective showed me the line-up.</p>
<p>Terrell Trammell has since been charged with robbery and is being held at 850 Bryant Street. He is not eligible for bail because he is on federal probation.</p>

<p><a href="http://zoriah.net">Zoriah</a> has a gift for photography. I first came across his work last night, and  immediately felt the impact. But even before I was moved by his images, I was blown away by <a href="http://www.zoriah.net/blog/2008/07/zoriah-clarific.html">his story</a>.</p>
<p>As an embedded journalist in Iraq, Zoriah has been traveling with the multi-national forces and covering the occupation first-hand. On June 26 he <a href="http://www.zoriah.net/blog/suicide-bombing-in-anbar-.html">witnessed the immediate aftermath of a suicide bombing</a> that left several dozen people dead.</p>
<p>Zoriah writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are searching homes for weapons and information regarding Al Qaeda in Iraq, when a message comes over the radio.  ???We have one killed in actions (KIA), and two wounded in action (WIA)???&#8221;</p>
<p>We grab our gear, throwing on our body armor, Kevlar helmets, gloves, goggles, and other proactive gear as we run out of the house&#8230;</p>
<p>I have nearly 70lbs. (31kg.) of equipment strapped to my body and, although I am in good physical shape, I feel the heat burning my lungs every time I inhale.  We see people running down the street in panic.  </p>
<p>The soldier who is running next to me glances onto the pavement at the same time as I do.  There is an ear on the ground.  About five feet away, we see a chunk of scalp with hair on a palm sized piece of skull.  We look at each other, realizing that we are walking into true madness ???and this is just the beginning.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the next few minutes, Zoriah documents the carnage snapping as quickly as he can. Before long he is ordered out of the area, but not before capturing at least two images of a Marine that had been killed in the attack.</p>
<p>On June 30, several days after the attack, Zoriah uploads his images and his account of the event to his blog. </p>
<p>By July 1, he had been removed from his assignment by the US Marine Corps <a href="http://joshwolf.net/blog/?p=396#more-396" class="more-link">(more&#8230;)</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s almost 2:00 AM, and I have to get up in less than 5 hours to move my car before street cleaning begins. That and I also have an appointment to get an oil change and inspection at 8AM.</p>
<p>The past week has been intense. </p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, I was offered a job as a reporter at the Palo Alto Daily Post, and today was my first day. In that interval, I somehow managed to get a car, and insurance (there&#8217;s a whole lot more as well, but I won&#8217;t bore you with the details).</p>
<p>If the haters who said I wasn&#8217;t a <em>real</em> journalist, are still lurking. I hope you don&#8217;t have too much indigestion after eating your words.</p>

<p></center></p>
<p>At tonight&#8217;s Berkeley City Council Meeting, council member Donna Spring will ask for an urgent agenda item be added to confront the University over blocking the public sidewalk along Piedmont Ave at the Oak Grove.</p>
<p><strong>SPRING:</strong><em> ???I&#8217;m hoping that six members of the council will be willing to add it to the agenda, and there I want to make a motion to ask that we write a letter to the university telling them that we need our sidewalk back again. We need public access and to get their barriers off the public sidewalks. If they want to restrict the tree sitters they&#8217;re gonna have to do it on their own property. Not use the public right-of-way to try to restrict the tree sitters from getting food and water.</em></p>
<p>Protesters first occupied the trees in the Oak Grove more than 18 months ago in an effort to stop a planned Sports complex adjacent to the stadium at UC Berkeley. Last Monday, in anticipation of a judge&#8217;s ruling, UC Berkeley brought in a Watsonville tree service company to remove the sitters&#8217; platforms and traverse lines.</p>
<p>On Sunday, police blocked supporters from providing food and water to the tree sitters. Ayr a supporter of the Oak Grove, told KPFA that he did not know how much food or water the tree sitters have left, but indicated the situation is not urgent.</p>
<p><strong>Ayr:</strong><em>&#8220;Obviously as each day passes their rations are getting lower and lower being that we&#8217;re not able to get them any new stuff, so we&#8217;re demanding that the university allow food and water in.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Dan Mogulof, executive director of public affairs at the university, said that the university feels it has achieved its goal of making it difficult for the tree sitters to maintain their protest.</p>
<p><strong>Mogulof:</strong><em> ???If they&#8217;re tired and if they&#8217;re hungry and thirsty then all they need do is come down and they can have everything they need. Having said that, we continue to monitor the situation on a day-by-day basis. We&#8217;re in constant contact with the people in the trees, they&#8217;re telling us that they have adequate supplies. But if we perceive, or hear about any significant change in the status quo, in so far as their health and safety and well-being is concerned, we&#8217;ll be ready to reevaluate our current position.???</em></p>
<p>Mogulof would not say whether or not the university would allow the protesters access to food or water after they exhaust their existing supplies. In a formal letter to City Manager Phil Kamlarz, the university affirmed that it is monitoring the health of the tree sitters, and will provide food and water to any protesters who come down.</p>
<p>Mayor Tom Bates said that he does not feel the University should take action against the tree sitters until the legal case has been completely resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Bates:</strong><em> ???Eventually this is gonna wind down, just not that far off. The future is here, so it looks like, very shortly, we&#8217;ll have a definitive answer to the question, ???Can they cut down the trees???? And if they can cut down the trees in the near future, which I wouldn&#8217;t like to see happen, and hope doesn&#8217;t happen, then obviously the tree sitters are gonna have to come out of the trees. So it seems to me that, right now, that the university oughta not try to starve them out, or not allow them to have water too, in order to stay in the trees until we get a definitive answer from the judge.???</em></p>
<p>Mogulof said he did not know why the university contracted with Williams Tree Service in Watsonville.</p>
<p><strong>Mogulof:</strong><em> ???I personally have no idea where that firm is from I wasn&#8217;t a party to any of those conversations, but to the best of my knowledge we selected a firm that had had specific experience with these sorts of events and activities in the past and were adaquetly trained and experienced to manage the situation. The fact is, is that  no one was seriously injured last week, that we did manage to achieve our objectives and as far as I know the only one seriously injured was an arborist who was bit by one of the protesters.???</em></p>
<p>The company has done business with UC Santa Cruz in the past. During the winter break, Williams Tree Service removed materials left near the site of a tree sit there. The Metro Santa Cruz Newspaper  reports that the tree service&#8217;s activities at the Santa Cruz site led vandals to damage company property held in its service yard. Citing safety concerns the University is refusing to speak publicly about the Tree Service company.</p>
<p>Dennis Williams of Williams Tree Service also refused to comment on the companies operations saying that he can&#8217;t speak about the matter until he has permission from the University police department. Mogoluf said he was unaware of any orders prohibiting Williams Tree Service from speaking to the media, and KPFA was unable to secure permission for Williams by the time of this broadcast.</p>
<p>For KPFA, in Berkeley, I&#8217;m Josh Wolf.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These notes were drafted as part of the <em>Citizen Media and the law &#8212; freedom and risk</em> breakout session at the Minnesota Journalism that Matters New Pamphleteers conference&#8230;</p>
<p>FOIA and public access:</p>
<ul>
<li>FOIA - the fee waiver has been expanded to include those who publish regularly, legal fees can now be recovered if you need to sue.</li>
<li>There is no exclusion for FOIA under copyright law.</li>
<li>Every state has something parallel to FOIA &#8212; some are good for citizen journalists whereas others are terrible</li>
<li> Open-meetings act: How do they define what falls under the act? Bloggers and professional media are covered equally</li>
<li>First ammendment right to criminal and civil trials and proceedings with an exemption for juvenile proceedings</li>
<li> The law provides some limits; however, generally speaking you can take photos and video in public places, but not private property. The states have been very restrictive regarding ride-alongs, telephoto photos in private area.</li>
<li> Public private property is treated as public space.</li>
<li>As a general rule you have a right to any public place, but whenever a security personnel asks you to leave, it is recommended that you leave. </li>
</ul>
<p>Risks of publication:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mainly defamation</li>
<li>You&#8217;re liable if you&#8217;ve done something you shouldn&#8217;t have done, or failed to do something you should have done.</li>
<li>The highest standard is a public official or figure who must prove actual malice - a subjective standard that means the publisher had reason to know the info was false.</li>
<li>Be consistent with whatever your standard practice is regarding notes</li>
<li>Be careful of creating contemporaneous documents that you have doubts about validity of information</li>
<li> The other category falls under private individuals who have a lower standard: negligence in verifying the information is accurate</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re thorough in your reporting you&#8217;ll reduce your risk of lawsuits.</li>
<li>Publication of private facts can also open you up to lawsuits</li>
<li>Intellectual property, copyright infringement, all expressive works are automatically covered under copyright unless expressly stated elsewhere</li>
<li>Communications decency act means that you will generally not be liable - even if you edit for civility and choose what comments to publish</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this, and more, can be found at the <a href="http://citmedialaw.org">Citizen Media Law Project</a>. There is an entry form to improve the database of legal issues. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That was the subject of the e-mail I received this morning from Jeff Marks the executive producer of <a href="http://moblogic.tv">MobLogic.TV</a>. He writes&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>Hey Josh</p>
<p>Just wanted to draw your attention to today&#8217;s time sensitive Moblogic.  In the spirit of the Sean Bell coverage we did, MobLogic is in Georgia this week, covering the second execution the state has carried out since the Supreme Court decided to allow lethal injections to continue.</p>
<p>To cover the story, we&#8217;re asking our viewers to comment, video comment, etc and tell us what aspects of the case they&#8217;d like to see covered.  We&#8217;re doing our best to create an interactive journalism experience.  We also gave out Lindsay&#8217;s phone number so viewers can call her directly with suggestions.</p>
<p>Really excited to get the word out about our little experiment, and hoping you could help us spread the word.  A quick blog post about it, or a link to the show, or even just broadcasting Lindsay&#8217;s number would be a huge help.  We&#8217;re trying to stir up how this stuff gets covered - it&#8217;s as much a media story as it is a death penalty story.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the show:</p>
<p>http://www.moblogic.tv/video/2008/05/21/execution-day-what-would-you-do/</p>
<p>&#8230;(one unrelated line and closing salutation omitted)</p></blockquote>
<p>Having not tuned into MobLogic for a while, I had missed their coverage of the verdict regarding Sean Bell, but found the episode in which <a href="http://www.moblogic.tv/video/2008/05/11/lindsay-arrested-yellow-journalism/">Lindsay is arrested at the protest</a> to be particularly insightful (I&#8217;m especially curious how exactly she managed to get a camera into her cell), and I&#8217;m really excited to watch how MobLogic is exploring new journalism. </p>
<p>Right now, the Moblogic crew is in Georgia where David Crowe is set to be executed tomorrow at 7PM. A Google news search turns up very little about his execution; in fact, it seems that Moblogic may be the only outlet actively covering the story. When it comes to the death penalty, or any story really, there are a lot of sides that can be explored, and a lot of questions that can be asked. In order to help navigate what Mob Logic should focus on, the show has asked people to offer suggestions by commenting on the <a href="http://www.moblogic.tv/video/2008/05/21/execution-day-what-would-you-do/">blog</a>, but in an effort to make themselves even more accessible, Lindsay Campbell has gone ahead and shared her number - (917)273-7212.</p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s unusual, but it isn&#8217;t unprecedented. I remember Robert Scoble talking about how he&#8217;s had his number on the internet for years, and Justin Gunn of Current TV shared his number after it was leaked with the rest of Paris Hilton&#8217;s cell phone, but it does demonstrate that Mob Logic is committed to having a conversation with their audience and pursuing networked journalism. Although others may suggest that it&#8217;s just a publicity stunt and she&#8217;s planning on switching to AT&#038;T when the 3G Iphone comes out in a couple weeks anyhow (by the way, I making that up)&#8230;</p>
<p>As of right now, 12:30PM - Lindsay has received 30 calls and 20 texts&#8230; I didn&#8217;t ask, but she didn&#8217;t mention if any of them were weird stalkerish types, but I&#8217;d expect all of the calls were legit.</p>

This is the piece that I put together with a musical backing that I added after posting my original application (the music is from <a href="http://ghosts.nin.com">Nine Inch Nails - Ghosts I</a> which has been released for free, but I&#8217;m not sure if the rights include using the tracks in other media and I didn&#8217;t want to send MTV an entry that possibly infringes on any copyrights).</p>
